## My Passions 💚

### Web Development <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/html5/html5-original.svg" title="HTML" alt="HTML" width="18" height="18"/>

I am a passionate web developer, always exploring new fields. I have worked with plenty of different tools to build my past web projects.

#### Frontend 👀

- **Plain HTML and CSS**. Old but gold. I still respect the method.
- [**EJS**](https://github.com/tj/ejs). My first go at using a templating language. I enjoyed working with it, but then focused on mastering *component-based development*.
- [**React**](https://reactjs.org/). My current frontend tool. I love working with it, but am still open to other technologies.
  - [**Tailwind**](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss). Tailwind made my CSS development times faster. For now I am sticking to it for styling my React components.

#### Backend 🦾

- [**PHP**](https://www.php.net/). My first backend language. I did not master it, because I quickly moved to Node.js.
- [**Express.js**](https://github.com/expressjs/express). My **go-to** library for backend at this moment. I am very comfortable with using it and can create complex APIs.
- [**uWebSocket.js**](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js). I like the freedom this library allows. It made it simple to write my own solution to connecting websockets with my cookie token-based backend API.
- [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/). I love using PostgreSQL in my projects. However, I am still exploring other database solutions.

#### Exploring 🧐

- [**Next.js**](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/). I am strongly contemplating using it as my backend base, because of its tight integration with React. I am sticking to Express.js for now for ease of use, but will be exploring Next.js in the near future.
- [**Vite**](https://github.com/vitejs/vite). Vite speeds up my development by a lot. I am exploring projects that build on top of it.
  - [**Vitedge**](https://github.com/frandiox/vitedge) for ESR
  - [**Vite SSR**](https://github.com/frandiox/vite-ssr) for SSR
- [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev/). I can't wait to start developing mobile apps!

I am uploading my projects starting **March 2022**.

### Programming

I started as a 3D modeller in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). After becoming advanced in it, I decided to start creating videogames in the [Unity](https://unity.com/) engine. I even took part in game jams with my friend! It was not only fun, but I also learned useful skills like file structuring and time management ⏰.
I then learned Python and soon moved to web development. It is my main passion to this day!

### Languages

I love learning languages and take the task very seriously. My current languages include:

- **English** 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 - Full Professional Proficiency
- **Czech** 🇨🇿 - Full Professional Proficiency
- **Russian** 🇷🇺 - Full Professional Proficiency
- **German** 🇩🇪 - Professional Working Proficiency
- **Italian** 🇮🇹 - Limited Working Proficiency
